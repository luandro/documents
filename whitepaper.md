# SWARAJ

## Abstract

SWARAJ is a platform and hub for creating, managing and organizing societies that are globally scallable. Movements such as permaculture, bioregionalism and ecovillages all hold in common what Ghandian Village Swaraj holds: the sense that society should be decentralized, thus organized in smaller self-governed and self-suficient communities living consciously and [non-violently](https://wikipedia.org/non-violence) within both social and natural environmets. The platform makes managing such decentralized communities possible by using [smart contracts](http://ethereum.org) to furfill services are usually tied to, and required trust in, highly centralized and violent institutions such as states and banks. The SWARAJ online hub runs independently in a P2P fashion once a [critical mass](https://wikipedia.org/critical_mass) of users is achieved, and is responsible for promoting funding initiatives for community projects, land aquisition, and development of aditional services for the platform ecosystem; as well as a global exchange for community goods, services and [smart-tokens](https://ethereum.org) as well as knowledge.

## Platform

The SWARAJ platform consists of a series of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that provides basic services to assist in managing and organizing communities. Basic services such as for self-governance (voting on issues and representatives, and managing assemblies), economic independence (interaction between local and global markets, credit and indicators), social security (identification, ownership, reputation) and exchange of scientific knowledge (collection and storage of data, and testing of methods). The contract also permits third-party contracts to plugin and interact with the SWARAJ platform, thus making it possible for a wide ecosystem of services to be created to assist in solving more complex problems such as education; transportation of goods, people and data; water and energy collection and distribution.
